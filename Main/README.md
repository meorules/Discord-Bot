# Discord Bot

 My FL DIscord Bot

Make sure to reset the Teams and TeamPlayers, clear the log along with the moneyLog and then running the application should go smooth.

When setting up the wordle portion, ensure the botDB is copied across to the Wordle folder and renamed to players.db. 
This will then import the players and sanatise the names and add them into players.js for use in the wordle bot. 
Exclusions are found in the excluded txt file and any player names can be added in the manual.txt file if need be. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach me at mazeneomar@gmail.com. If you could put your subject as "FL Discord Bot".
